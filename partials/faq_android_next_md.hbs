### What are the differences compared to Element X Android?

I'm maintaining a list [here](https://github.com/SchildiChat/schildichat-android-next/blob/main/FEATURES.md), but note that this may not be complete and partly outdated.

### How do I set up UnifiedPush?

Follow the guide at [unifiedpush.org](https://unifiedpush.org/) to set up UnifiedPush.
Once you have that working, SchildiChat should pick it up automatically.
To test whether the your push distributor was successfully picked up, let someone send you a message which triggers a notification, then check Settings/Turtle Tweaks/Push Info.

If you want to use ntfy, and don't want to self-host a server yourself, feel free to use [ntfy.schildi.chat](https://ntfy.schildi.chat).

### Why is UnifiedPush not working?

Here are some common reasons for UnifiedPush not working:

- When using a custom gateway on a non-standard port, [this is currently broken](https://github.com/SchildiChat/SchildiChat-android/blob/6076df81ed60089cdad6e9e2b75a93ea5cd2ae33/vector/src/main/java/im/vector/app/core/pushers/UnifiedPushHelper.kt#L221).
- When using Gotify (which is deprecated, you should consider switching to a different distributor): didn't install Gotify-UP (the "-UP" part is important!), or forgot to install common-proxies?

For debugging UnifidedPush setups, first try to get the "UP-Example" application to work, which you can get on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.unifiedpush.example/). You may also get help at [#unifiedpush:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#unifiedpush:matrix.org).

### Is there any way to find (and join) public rooms?

No, this has not been implemented in Element X yet, and will not be added to SchildiChat Next before Element X adds it.

### Where to report bugs and request features?

Feel free to support existing issues, or file new issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/SchildiChat/schildichat-android-next/issues).  
In case you experience bugs that require logs to debug, such as app crashes or other bugs not commonly reproducable, send a bug report from the app's settings ("Report a problem") and make sure to have the logs option enabled.
Also make sure to always provide a concise description of what your issue is and what you did in order to observe it.
