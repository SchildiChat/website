### What does the name mean?

Schildi = Schildkr√∂te = German for turtle. So "Turtle"-Chat. Feel free to call it Shieldy-Chat (shield for security?), if that's easier to pronounce for you.

### What version of Element is SchildiChat based on?

When you have a look at the SchildiChat version, the part before "sc" is the upstream Element version that your current SchildiChat build is based on.

### What is this "upstream" that people keep mentioning in issues/chats/...?

Since SchildiChat is a fork of [Element](https://element.io/), "upstream" refers to "Element".
