### What does the name mean?

Schildi = Schildkr√∂te = German for turtle. So "Turtle"-Chat. Feel free to call it Shieldy-Chat (shield for security?), if that's easier to pronounce for you.

### What does the icon depict?

[A turtle with a post horn.](/img/real_schildichat_turtle.jpg)

### What is the goal of this Element fork?

We mainly focus on tweaking the UI to our likings and usually do not want to go deep into architectural changes to reduce merge conflicts with upstream.  
Sometimes, we like to play with additional community-based features that Element does not prioritize, which means we might support a few more [MSCs](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals) than Element do.  
It may also happen more often than expected that we include additional bug fixes compared to Element, if the Element team misses some bugs which become apparent in our internal testing.
Of course, this does not imply that SchildiChat has less bugs, since we're not safe from introducing new ones either.  

To summarize, the main goal of the SchildiChat clients is as following:
we want to take a Matrix client that is good, and tweak it just to match our taste, since Element's design team has a different taste than we have, and our priorities do not always align with those upstream.  
We are not trying to please any particular kind of target user group, except those who share our taste :)

### What version of Element is SchildiChat based on?

When you have a look at the SchildiChat version, the part before "sc" is the upstream Element version that your current SchildiChat build is based on.

### What is this "upstream" that people keep mentioning in issues/chats/...?

Since SchildiChat is a fork of [Element](https://element.io/), "upstream" refers to "Element".

### What is the hash of the SchildiChat Developer's app signing key?

SHA-256 hashes for builds in the main repo, as provided by `keytool -printcert -jarfile` from the build machine, by using [AppVerifier](https://github.com/soupslurpr/AppVerifier) on an android device, or by using `apksigner --verify --print-certs` in a command prompt or Termux on android.

### How can I help to translate SchildiChat?

You can translate SchildiChat-specific text at [translate.schildi.chat](https://translate.schildi.chat)!
For Element-specific translations, visit their [weblate](https://translate.element.io) and [localazy](https://localazy.com/p/element) websites, and we will get it for our next upstream merge.

### How can I donate you something?

Thanks for asking!
However, we currently do not accept donation.
Our goal is not to make money with this project, but just create a chat client that we enjoy using.
As a result, we also do not feel any obligations to satisfy user expecations or wishes - this is a hobby project, after all.
Feel free to donate to a charity of your choice instead, or to matrix.org directly for maintaining the matrix specification.
