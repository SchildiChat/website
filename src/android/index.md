SchildiChat comes in two variants:

- The <span class="badge fcm">FCM</span> variant uses Google's FCM push notifications. If you have the Google Play Store installed on your device, this is likely the version that you want.
- The <span class="badge foss">FOSS</span> (free and open source) variant does not include any proprietary libraries, and thus does not support Google's FCM push notifications. If you are particularly privacy-aware and want to avoid any contact with Google servers, this is likely the version that you want. However, depending on your setup, this version might result in a higher battery usage and delayed messages.

While the variants differ in whether they support FCM push notifications, they both do support [UnifiedPush](https://unifiedpush.org/), which allows users to choose an alternative push provider. Please refer to the [UnifiedPush website](https://unifiedpush.org/) if you are interested in how to set this up.

Depending on the installation method, you can get either stable releases only, or beta releases, if you want to help testing the latest features and don't mind some extra bugs.
